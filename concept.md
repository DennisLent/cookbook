# Concept Plan

The idea is to create a cookbook application that runs Django on the backend and angular on the frontend. This makes the development easy and allows for a wide range of customization. 

## Key features:
- persistent login (SSO)
- public read, owner write
- create/edit/delete recipes
- add recipes from various sources
- user divided model
- backend support to allow recipe creation from various sources
- frontend support for both desktop and mobile
